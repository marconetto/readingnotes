## Reading notes / references


Here are just some pointers and a few notes on some documents I'm reading/read.
You may find some interesting pointers here. I'm mostly interested into HPC,
distributed systems, usability issues for complex platforms, ML/DL applied to
resource management and usability, among other topics.
